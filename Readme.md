# VGO Idle Clicker

In this VGO Idle Clicker game, the goal is to produce as many episodes of VGO as possible. To be able to do that you click the produce button and buy store items that make production feel like it's running on its own.

## Contribution

I want this project to be accessible to as many contributors as possible. Therefor, this project shall only use vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This project shall not use and JS framework like React, Vue, Angular, etc.! Anyone with a GitHub account can contribute by adding issues (bugs, ideas, feature requests) or sending pull requests. Even if you don't have a GitHub account, just send me a message in the VGO Discord!

## How To run the game

Download the repository, and double click on `src/index.html`. Have fun!
