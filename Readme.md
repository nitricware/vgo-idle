# VGO Idle Clicker

In this VGO Idle Clicker game, the goal is to produce as many episodes of VGO as possible. To be able to do that you click the produce button and buy store items that make production feel like it's running on its own.

## Contribution

This project shall not use and JS framework like React, Vue, Angular, etc.! Anyone with a GitHub account can contribute by adding issues (bugs, ideas, feature requests) or sending pull requests. Even if you don't have a GitHub account, just send me a message in the VGO Discord!
